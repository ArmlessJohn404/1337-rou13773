# Well...
## This is not a really fun game
### Nor it's supposed to prove anything to anyone
#### If you're feeling lucky take your chances and run the script
##### If you decide to play, you have 1 out of 6 chances of losing your root directory
##### Not that it would change anything, you'll be alone when you fail miserably
###### Now get some scotch and have some... "fun"... I guess... good luck...
